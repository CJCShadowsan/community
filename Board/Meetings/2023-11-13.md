Notes:
* We have domains, a github organization, a press release and an in-person board! 
* The MoU scope has been limited to LANL, CSCS, and Bristol which achieves our goals and reduces the layers of lawyers that will need to comment and clear the language.
* Discussed and agreed to the existing simple governance text stating that board members must nominate sites to join and board must vote to accept
* Discussed the need for a governance item to deal with sites leaving the consortium, both voluntarily and involuntarily - No Decision
* Discussed possible benefits of HPSF and other Linux Foundation organziations.  Tabled for now.
    - Marketing/PR
    - Membership Tiers
    - Maturity Ladders
    - Other?
* Discussed the use of CUG as a forum for discussion of modular concepts.  Tabled for now
* We plan to submit an official bof at isc to cover api and architecture. deadline for submission is jan 10th - Action needed from @alexlovelltroy
* Need a followup board mtg soon to admit many sites and vote pretty soon after SC and discuss tiered membership - Action needed from Tim Randles
