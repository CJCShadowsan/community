## Abstract

OpenCHAMI, initiated in 2023 by a consortium including CSCS, the University of Bristol, NERSC, LANL, and HPE, focuses on enhancing HPC system management through an open-source, cloud-like approach. This project aligns with the evolving landscape of HPC where the integration of AI workloads necessitates a bridge between traditional HPC tools and broader cloud technologies.

In this presentation, I will outline OpenCHAMI's guiding approach to cloud-like management of HPC systems. Through an exploration of the code we've released so far and the problems our partners are most concerned with solving, I'll invite the audience to consider what other unsolved problems in ths area their facilities face. I'll explore how our Open Source Governance Model is working for us and invite them to consider joining us and/or using a similar model themselves.
